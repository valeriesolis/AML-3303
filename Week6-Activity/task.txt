Case Study: Optimizing Taxi Operations with NYC Trip Data

## Context
A large taxi company in New York City wants to optimize its operations and improve profitability. They collect millions of trip records every month, including details like passenger count, trip distance, total fare, tip amount, and pickup/dropoff times. Processing such large datasets efficiently is critical for timely business decisions.

## Objective
Use Polars and multithreading to perform fast, parallel analysis of taxi trip data. The goal is to compute multiple key performance metrics simultaneously for different passenger groups to help the operations team make decisions.

## Problem Statement
The operations team wants answers to these questions:
    1. How much revenue is generated by trips for 1, 2, 3, and 4+ passengers?
    2. What is the average tip amount and maximum tip for each passenger group?
    3. How many trips occur per passenger group?

The dataset is large (hundreds of thousands of rows or more). Traditional row-wise processing is too slow, so parallel computation is needed to produce insights quickly.
